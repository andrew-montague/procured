# Digital Sound Desk Specification

## 1. General Requirements:

- The mixing console must be a fully digital system suitable for live sound reinforcement and studio recording.
- It should support high channel counts, flexible routing, and advanced processing capabilities, providing comprehensive control over all aspects of audio mixing.

## 2. Input and Output Channels:

- The console must support a minimum of 32 input channels and 16 output buses, with additional capability for expansion via digital networking.
- Each input channel should include features such as fully parametric EQ, dynamics processing (compressor, gate), and assignable delay.
- The console must provide at least 8 DCA (Digitally Controlled Amplifier) groups and 6 mute groups for flexible control over channel groups and submixes.

## 3. Digital Networking and Expandability:

- The console should support industry-standard digital audio networking protocols (e.g., AES50, Dante, MADI) for high-capacity, low-latency audio transmission.
- Must include a digital snake/stage box option that supports at least 32 remote controllable mic preamps and 16 analog outputs.
- Stage box connection must use a robust digital protocol, such as AES50, to ensure reliable signal integrity and low latency over long distances.

4. User Interface and Control:

- Physical control elements should include motorized faders, rotary encoders, and dedicated buttons for fast access to frequently used functions.
- It should allow customizable user layers for channel faders and DCA groups, enabling operators to organize channels according to their workflow preferences.

5. Processing and Effects:

- The console should include a comprehensive library of high-quality built-in effects, including reverbs, delays, modulation effects, and graphic EQs, with a minimum of 4 stereo FX slots available for simultaneous use.
- Support for multi-band compression and dynamic EQ processing on all channels and buses.
- Ability to store and recall scenes, show files, and presets, allowing for quick changes between different setups and performances.

6. Connectivity and Integration:

- Must provide a variety of connectivity options, including analog XLR inputs/outputs, AES/EBU digital audio outputs, and multiple USB ports for data transfer and external device connectivity.
- Integrated USB or Ethernet ports for direct multitrack recording to a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) or external storage device.
- Support for remote control via tablets, smartphones, or laptops, allowing wireless mixing from anywhere in the venue.

7. Build Quality and Portability:

- The console should be built with a rugged, roadworthy chassis suitable for touring, installation, and broadcast environments.
- It must be compact and lightweight enough for easy transport and setup while providing all necessary I/O and control capabilities.

9. Software and Firmware:

- The console should come with upgradable firmware and software options to ensure compatibility with future updates and additional features.
- Must include comprehensive offline editing software for pre-configuring setups and show files.
